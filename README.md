# Student-Schedule-Checkin

Allows users to enter student's info, including their 
CWID, FirstName, LastName, Gender, BirthDate, ClassID, ClassDate, Grade
storing them into a dictionary essentially creating a student object.

Allows users to then pull up a list of students enrolled in specific classes

ie) Math 101 will display student 1, student 2, student 3 that are currently enrolled in that course
